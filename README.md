### This is my repo for personal config files and so. ###

If you are going to use some of these config files, you are welcomed!

Hopefully, you will find here something useful for you. But, please, be careful to run make command from the root repository directory. Take a look inside Makefile first.

It probably will overwrite some of your existing files.
